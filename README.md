Introduction
The React Color Changer is a simple, interactive web application built with React that allows users to dynamically change the background color of the main application area. It demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as state management (useState), component reusability, prop drilling for event handling, and mapping over data to render UI elements. The application is styled using custom CSS for a modern and responsive user interface.

Features
Dynamic Background Color Change: Instantly updates the background color of the main application area upon button click.

Color Palette: Provides a predefined set of vibrant colors for selection.

Reusable Button Component: A dedicated Button component promotes modularity and reusability.

Separation of Concerns: Color data is managed in a separate constants file, enhancing maintainability.

Responsive Design: Utilizes plain CSS with media queries to ensure the layout adapts gracefully across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Smooth Transitions: Background color changes are animated with a smooth transition effect.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast build tool for modern web projects (used for development server).

CSS: For custom styling and responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6+): The core programming language.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: (LTS version recommended) - Download from nodejs.org.

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn - npm comes bundled with Node.js.

Cloning the Repository
git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with your actual repository URL
cd react-color-changer    # Navigate into the project directory

Installing Dependencies
Once inside the project directory, install the necessary npm packages:

npm install
# OR
yarn install

Running the Development Server
After installing dependencies, you can start the development server:

npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev

This will typically open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173 (or another available port). The server will automatically reload the page as you make changes to the code.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard React application structure:

└── vite.config.js             # Vite build tool configuration
└── README.md                  # This file

Usage
